#### Joining the Call

The meeting will take place over Skype. To participate, please e-mail Felicity Dykas (DykasF [at] missouri [dot] edu) with the Skype username at which you wish to be called.

#### Agenda Items

* Introductions
* Desired Outcomes for the Group
* Reporting out to the larger IG

#### Meeting Notes

Attendees:

* Michael Bolam (University of Pittsburgh)
* Kevin Clair (University of Denver)
* Felicity Dykas (University of Missouri)
* Jennifer Eustis (University of Connecticut)
* Joseph Nicholson (University of North Carolina-Charlotte)
* Martha Tenney (Barnard College)

Themes that emerged from the introductions:

* local authorities
* using ORCID to link to faculty creators
* linked open data and authorities, getting our metadata ready for RDF
* improving methods for content creators to enter metadata (authorities as a part of that)
* support for NACO records and adding MARCXML NACO records as MADS in Islandora
  * using the Entity Solution Pack
* Authority control in consortial Islandora instances with many levels/methods of cataloging

Desired outcomes of the group:

Wish list for desired functionalities to make maintaining authority files in Islandora easier
* [Entity Solution Pack](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/ISLANDORA715/Entities+Solution+Pack) (handles MADS and EAC-CPF) -- how successful is it at what it sets out to do?
* Citation module (packaged with Scholar Solution Pack) also exists but it only supports MADS

The 7.x-1.7 release team is asking for comment as the new release is prepared; it's possible to download a VM with Islandora pre-installed and test. A possible charge for the group would be to download it and try out the authority pieces of it (Entity Solution Pack, etc.) and make recommendations on how it could be improved (to be forwarded to the roadmap team).

Develop a list of desired functions in Islandora--
* loading LC subject terms directly into the metadata form builder (through the taxonomy feature)
  * Once a term is loaded, it auto-completes when a user begins to enter data in the ensuing field, e.g. entering "au" in the Role field, it will complete to "author"
* Do we want to invest in the XML forms, or [is Islandora pointing in another direction when it comes to metadata entry](http://islandora.ca/content/future-forms-islandora)?
  * A discussion of implementing the XML forms ensued; the custom forms available online were mentioned as examples of how to provide for local taxonomy support in metadata entry, such as UConn's and Florida State's.
* Drupal 6 used to be able to go out and fetch data from authority files but it was lost w/ Drupal 7
* Taxonomies only support the subject term, w/o any other identifying information (such as URI or term source); *a possible desired feature we could recommend*
* Looking at the Entity Solution Pack to see how it works and if there are future directions for it we can recommend, or if we'd recommend that Islandora find another way of handling our use cases (see below)
  * better integration with the XML Forms or their eventual successor
  * better handling of relator codes and relationships
  * better handling of topical/subject terms
* Dynamic updating of authority files--link to a URI, the URI would resolve to the most updated version of an authority record (w/ more information about the entity described at the URI)

Develop a list of use case scenarios for managing authority data in Islandora:
* add use cases to the [Github](https://github.com/islandora-interest-groups/Islandora-Metadata-Interest-Group/tree/main/Authorities-Subgroup)
* Other platforms that have relatively powerful authority management features?
  * ArchivesSpace ([LCNAF plugin](https://github.com/archivesspace/archivesspace/tree/main/plugins/lcnaf); not perfect but gets at some basic authority download features)
  * DSpace and Digital Commons (d/l CSV, make updates, u/l CSV)
  * Omeka has a plugin that links to [id.loc.gov](http://id.loc.gov) and allows you to download name/subject records

Most of the discussion above concerned the forms; how would this work for batch ingests of metadata? Are there any reconciliation services that can ensure authority control in batch ingests? Is this something that should be built into Islandora, or do we recommend external reconciliation services (e.g. LODRefine) that people should use *before* batch ingest? What about reporting features? Are there recommendations we could make for Islandora reporting of e.g. new terms, unauthorized/local terms that may have a URI from an external authority file? Any existing models to cover the batch ingest use case(s)?

##### To-do list

* Investigate the Entity Solution Pack (Jennifer, Joseph, Kevin volunteered) to see how many of our desired features and use cases it satisfies
* Contribute use cases to the github page
* Look at [Drupal Taxonomies and XML Form Builder](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/islandora/O5bXlqeAVoc) feature; see if it satisfies our desired features and use cases

The group agreed to meet monthly at 1:00pm EST on the first Tuesday of each month.
