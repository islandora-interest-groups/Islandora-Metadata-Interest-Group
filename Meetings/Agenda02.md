### Introductions

### Hydra Descriptive Metadata Group - MODS/RDF Descriptive Metadata Subgroup
 - Hydra has many subgroups
 - They are not necessarily hydra-specific (some more than others)
 - Nick invites folks here to get involved with these - sign up, there is no need to be involved in Hydra to be in these groups
 - As we move to Fedora 4, we can do more things with RDF properties, so the question of MODS/RDF comes up, and Hydra Metadata Group made this a subgroup
 - On 'Linked Data' more broadly, we need further discussions defining Linked Data if we want to publish and consume; we need to identify how we can consume, identify, publish. 
 - Jennifer: the Islandora Metadata group doesn’t need to reproduce Hydra Metadata group here, so she invites interested folks to go sign up for that MODS/RDF or other Hydra Metadata subgroups. We will email group saying such.

### Wiki
- Discussion generally about structure of wiki - has been set up for the Metadata Group, now to get people to start working on and adding content/documentation
- Idea of a wiki page for use cases/user stories brought up - page created, will also apply to each subgroups' work as well
- Led to next discussion point:

### Subgroups/Working Groups
- How to organize working groups? 
- Organize via topic - and if group is interested they can take a topic and break off.
- Subgroups should start now, and via email/wiki/other discussions, subgroups can create their goals/deliverables and report back on these to the next Islandora Metadata Group Meeting

### Decided Subgroups
- Metadata Tools
- Investigate Enhancement Features (including XML Forms, Microdata)
- Fedora 4 (PCDM, Linked Open Data, etc.)
- Hydra Compatibility
- Metadata Best Practices (Profiles, Documentation, Mappings, etc.)
- Authorities
