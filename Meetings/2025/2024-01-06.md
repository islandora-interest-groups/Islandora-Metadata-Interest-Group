### Agenda: 
* Announcements
* Open Conversation 


### Notes:
Announcements
* Chris represents the MIG at the Leadership Group, which met in December. At this point, there is nothing to report.
Open Conversation
* Most institutions are in the midst of migrating from Islandora 7 to modern or have completed the migration.
* Mapping many fields (MODS/MARC) into a smaller subset of fields is challenging.
* Mapping from/to MODS, MARC, and Dublin Core is complex. Issues with concatenated data points are not always straightforward translations. Combining various standards into one standard is a challenge.
* To accommodate various data points, build separate Drupal between Maps, books, etc.
* Deleting a field associated with a Facet breaks faceting, which is challenging to troubleshoot.
* Discussion about the merits of using a taxonomy for rights statements, using the associated taxonomy description field to display text and Rights URL.




### Next meeting
